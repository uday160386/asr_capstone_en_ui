cried he waving the lantern before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him
they were up on the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the Hutt and Studley had tripped over the edge of the Reversed flap mouth of this pit
at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of gamewell
they then renew their journey and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs
Warrenton spoke thus with significance to show Robin that he was not to thank Jeffrey's claims to the estate would be passed by

Nae Nae lording answered Warrenton with a half laugh
will whispered Robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
Robin Fitzgerald saw that his doubts of Warrington had been unfair and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them
Robin entered the Hut dragging the unwilling Esquire after him

his toes rang pleasantly on warrington's ears and forth with a good Fellowship was heralded between them
they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of game
yet he will teach you a few tricks when Morning Has Come

he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the Hall holding him by the arm

young fit suit had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the squire
presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
Studley was by his side in the Flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault
from the Blackness behind the light they heard a voice Warrenton
will Christy and studly who it shows in his couch across the door of his young masters chamber sprang up at once and answer
will there be felon anxious interview mistress fit suits arguing for and against the squires project in the breath

the head and chief of the riot the Nottingham Apprentice with clenched fists threatened monthly she
what is the tunnelton rioting Cried Out The Squire authoritatively and he blew twice on the silver whistle which hungered his belt
he began to confused complaint against the wizard who had vanished behind the curtain on the left
give not so Earnest a mind to these memories child
nay we refuse the request most politely most noble said the little stroller
The Squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself
he was like unto my father in a way and yet was not my father
I could not see my boy injured Excellence for but doing his duty as one of Cumberland Sons
and then they became vexed and would have snatched your purse from us
a golden fortune and a happy life
but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came
cries of a Nottingham a Nottingham
before them fled the stroller and his three sons capless and terrified
sister Nell do you hear these Marvels
he gave way to the others very readily and retreated unperceived by The Squire and mistress fit suits to the rear of the tent
this was so sweet of Lady sir and in some manner I do think she died
and mine is Will stutley shall we become rats
Robin Fitz
also there was a Stripling page who turned into a maid

have your Will child if the boy also will sit in Monte answered feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then
it'll be no disappointment to me
will you forgive me now
the wine did certainly bring back the color to the squires cheeks
called out for Robin to give him an arm
friends said Mount Fiji faintly to the wrestlers bear us escort so far as the sheriff's house
these escapades are not for old game well LED his day has come to Twilight
I like you will you are the second will that I have met and light within two days is there a sign in that
they were left to their own devices
mistress Fitz had been carried off by the sheriff's daughter and her Maids as soon as they had entered the house so that Robin alone had the care of Mount Vishay
right willingly for between us we have won the battle answered Robin
it will not be safe for you to stay here now
he made an effort to hide his condition from them all and Robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm

Master monceaux the Sheriff of Nottingham was mightily put about when told of the riot

what is your name lording asked the little stroller presently
but I wrestled with this fellow and do know that he played unfairly in the second bout
Robin and the little Tumblr between them try to force the Squire to stand back and very valiantly do these two comport themselves
thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent Robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great Shout
he felt for and found the Wizards black cloth The Squire was quite out of breath
the strollers took their part in it with Hardee's ass now that they had some chance of beating off their phones
he began but the captured Apprentice set up an instant Shout
spoke to Squire losing all patient and it was to you that I gave another person consolation
so I did push this fellow
it is enough said George game will sharply as he turned upon the crow

he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern
it's a stock company in Rich
it was a serious crime indeed Mr Watson told them and Tom Gates made fair to serve a lengthy term in the state's prison as a consequence of his rash Act
sometimes I'm that yearning for a smoke I'm nearly crazy and I don't know which is worse dying one way or the other
it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved
where is Tom where's the nearest replied that Taylor Coleman
he unlocked the door and called here's visitors Tom
I can't see it in that light set the old lawyer
if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed as freedom
oh say that's different observed Markham altering as Demeter
BBC gates at once asked
but under the circumstances I doubt of such an arrangement could be made
he looked up rather ungraciously but motion them to be seated
I'm running for representative on the Republican ticket said Kenneth quietly
he was soft-hearted and impetuous said Beth and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost
but they could not have proven a case against Lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably a mere Blu
we wish to talk with him answered Kenneth talk
and it ruins a man's disposition
give me a check for $150 and I'll turn over to you the forge check and cash further proceedings
he detested the grasping disposition that would Endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young Gates

and he deserves a term in States prison
I'm not electioneering just now
some girl has been in here twice to interview my men and I have refused to admit
it has cost me twice $60 and annoyance
Beth an easy out of Silence nudged him
there was a Grimm smile of amusement on his shrewd face
I'll pay all the cops besides
and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of $150
I have my own reasons Mr Marshall
you're foolish why should you do all this
he might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp
it won't be much but I'm grateful to find a friend
a fresh wholesome looking boy was Tom Gates was steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
they received in the little office by a man named Markham who was the jail
Fairview is 12 miles away but by 10:00 they drew up at the county jail
sit down please set gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a bench here
I'm going to see Mr Marshall said Kenneth and discover what I can do to assist you thank you sir
we have heard something of your story said Kenneth and are interested in it
they left him then for the Jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office
I've seen lots of that kind of my day
I didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not I did it and I'm glad I did it
whose name did you sign to the check ask Kenneth
it was better for him to think the girl and feeling than to know the truth
I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant but Marshall never even thanked me
he spoke simply Butt Paste up and down the narrow cell in front of them
set Kenneth noticing the boys face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
I was bookkeeper so it was easy to get a blank check and Forge the signature
old will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since Mrs Rogers had her accident
Ben Rogers wouldn't do anything but leader around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin
as regards my robbing the company I'll say that I saved him a heavy loss one day
sorry we haven't any reception room in the jail
she Rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath
they excite me in some way and I can't bear them you must excuse me
Eliza Parsons shook her head
how are the features and 4:00 any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story
For the First Time The Maids seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
her manner was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well-bred composure and calm reliance
for a moment Beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face
she was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at Elmhurst a plain black gown with a white apron and cap
her eyes wandered to the maids hands
she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocks slowly back and forth I'm sorry but
Louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their Goodwill that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
but it can't be protested the
will you leave me alone in my own room or must I go away to escape you
I wish I knew myself she cried Fier
I'm Elizabeth Parsons
these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing pitster Forbes
Eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock
I attend to the household mending you know and care for the Lin
you speak like an educated person said Beth wonderingly where is your home
this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at Elmhurst and the only one within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been the invited guests
and this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
the description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political League was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus Mr Hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were
the attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted for seeing great success for their fight
the only thing necessary was to fix Seth Reynolds and this Hopkins arranged personally
tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served
the Fairview band was engaged to discourse as much Harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests
under ordinary conditions Reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect Hopkins
she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted
so to the surprise of the democratic committee and all his friends Mr Hopkins announced that he would oppose Forbes aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
we ought to have more attendance Beth said Louise approaching her cousin
won't you run into the house and see if Martha can't spare one or two more Maids
one of Mr Hopkins first tasks after calling his faithful henchmen around him was to make a careful canvas of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
Beth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet Eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
the housekeeper led the way in Beth followed
the Democratic committee figured out a way to do this
The Weeknd contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from the opposition
she was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when Aunt Jane was their mistress here and Beth was her special favorite
which thou Dost scatter on every little blade of grass that Springs revives the milked cow and tames the fire breathing steed
like the doves voice like transient day like music in the air ah
cell is like a watery bow and like a parting cloud like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon an infant's face
she ceased and smiled in tears then sat down in her silver shrine
and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time
but still is like a faint Cloud Kindle that the Rising Sun I vanished from my pearly throne and who shall find my place
and why it scatters its bright Beauty through the humid air
the lily of the valley breathing in the humble grass answered the lovely Maiden said I am a watery weed and I am very small and love to dwell in lowly Vale so weak the Gilded butterfly scarce purchase on my head yet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all walks in the valley and each mourn over me spreads his hand saying Rejoice that humble grass that newborn lily flower
why fade these children of the
the cloud then showed his golden head and his bright form emerged
I pass away yet I complain and no one hears my voice
why Fades the Lotus of the water
or an eye of gifts and Graces showering fruits and coined gold
does send a little cloud and hover before the eyes of fell
to fade away like morning Beauty from her mortal day down by the river of Madonna her soft voice is heard and thus her gentle lamentation Falls like morning dew
oh life of this offspring
a little Cloud the Virgin said I charge thee to tell me why thou complain is now when in 1 hour that fade away then we shall seek thee but not find a fell is like to be
why a tongue impressed with honey from every wind
Hawaiian ear a Whirlpool Fierce to draw Creations in
image of weakness art thou but a worm
in fear of style because I vanish and I'm seeing no more
it is to tenfold life to love to peace and raptures holy unseen descending way my light Wings flowers and Court the fair I do to take me to her shining tent the Weeping virgin trembling kneels before the Risen son
I see they lay helpless and naked weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with Mother's smiles
and lay me down and die cold bed and leave my Shining Light
and says Thou mother of my children I have loved thee and I have given the a crown that none can take away
come forth worm and the Silent Valley to thee pensive Queen
the helpless worm arose and sat upon the lilies leaf and the bright clouds sailed on to find his partner in the Veil
why should the Mistress of the veils of Harrah's
lives not alone nor of itself fear not and I will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice
golden band and never part but walk United bearing food to all our tender flours
thou gentle made of Silent valleys and of modest Brooks for Thou shalt be clothed in light and fed with Morning Manna till Summer's heat melts the beside the fountains and the Springs to flourish in Eternal veils they why should they complain
my pilgrims staff gave out green leaves with morning dues in pearls
I love the freely as men strive for right I love the purely as they turn from prays
to shoot my soul's full meaning into future years that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endures from life that disappears
and though I have grown Serene and strong since then I think that God has willed a still renewable fear
nay I rather thrilled distrusting every light that seemed to kill the onward path and fear to over lean a finger even
I think all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine
but Thou Art not such a lover my beloved
I love the with the passion put to use in my old grease and with my childhood's faith
I love the with the love I seemed to lose with my lost Saints I love the with the breath Smiles tears of all my life and if God choose I shall but love thee better after death
thou can't wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it's soon when others cry too late
when called before I told how hastily I dropped my flowers or break off from a game
Musselman's and Guy Wars throw kerchiefs at a smile and have no Ruth for any weeping
dearest teach me so to pour out gratitude as thou Dost good
I did not wrong myself so but I placed a wrong on the
a ring of amethyst I could not wear here planer to my side then that first kiss
all is said without a word
I sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with Souls that tremble through their happy eyelids from an uneven yet prodigal inward Joy
that was the Christmas of Love which loves own crown with sanctifying sweetness did proceed the third upon my lips was folded down and perfect purple State since when indeed I have been proud and said my love my own
and love be false
alas I have grieved so I am Hard To Love
shall I never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each and turn nor count it strange when I look up to drop on a new range of walls and Floors another home than this
Olaf Olaf
open iHeart wide and fold within the wet wings of thy dove
if he to keep one oath must lose one Joy by his life's star foretold
slow to World greetings quick with its own list when the Angels speak
could it mean to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow
in the gardeners boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft
the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man Drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shown
the word flamed up splendidly under the large Brewing copper and its side so deeply
now that two is over
in the courtyard some of the married children were playing who had danced at Christmas round the fir tree and we're so glad that the sight of him
only that one answer the tree
who is Humpy Dumpy ask the mice
the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree side after all it was very pleasant when the Sleek little mice sat around me and listen to what I told them
if it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
it is a very stupid story
however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end
don't you know one about bacon and hello candles can't you tell any other stories
squeak squ
then goodbye said the rats and they went home
no set the tree
and then what happens then
oh that made him so angry
I won't Trimble tomorrow
thought the fir tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree
rejoice in thy growth said the Sunbeam
to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the world
I would say no if I am destined for So Glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
I am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
in Autumn the woodcutters always came and felt some of the largest trees
but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
something better something still Grandeur must follow but what
yes and something better something still grinder will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and rattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
this evening they all said
where I but already on the cart
out in the woods to the nice little fir tree
the place he had was a very good one the sun showing on him as to Fresh Air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades Pines as well as furs
where I in the war room with all the Splendor and magnificence
how it will shine this evening
perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me
the departure was not at all agreeable
rejoice in our presence of the air and the sunlight
rejoice in my own fresh youth
the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is Splendid we don't want the others
it blazed up famously help help
the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
cant read wav file
cry the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire
there are two were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so
the acts struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the Earth with a sigh he felt a Pang it was like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
Humpty Dumpty fell downstairs and yet he married the princess
that's the way of the world
he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him anymore perhaps not even the Birds
have you not met them anywhere
but I shall tell only one story
and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer
drawing a little fat man towards the tree
this happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very calmly sized trembled at the site for the Magnificent great trees fell to the Earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were late in carts and the horses dragged them out of the wood
they were so extremely curious
how kind man is after all
is now winter Out of Doors thought the tree
there's many a one considerably older than I am
and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
play snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches
I am by no means old said the fir tree
time enough had he 2 for his Reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when it lasted somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in the corner out of the way
it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in
and then he told all about his Youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
I know no such place set the tree
in the whole night the tree Stood Still and in deep thought
but it was not the fir tree that they meant
set the furry thinking over what he had himself related
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the Loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
what's the meaning of this thought the tree
yes in reality those were happy times
Jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to Eva and was now reduced to Silence by his praises
quite satisfied said Eva
we are quite satisfied now Captain battle axe said my wife
Mrs never been you must indeed be proud of your son
therefore I feel myself quite able as president of this Republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the Servants of a friendly Ally
I have come to your Shores Mr President with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world
their masters said Mrs never Bend
I did not mean said Captain battle axe to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water
I can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since I have been on board
have you ever Creswell or not been good looking had Jack been still at College had sir Kennington oval remained in England had Mr Bennett and the bar keeper not succeeded in stopping my Carriage on the hill should I have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend
I am my wife and son and the two cresswell's and three or four others agreed to die on board the ship on the next
thinking of all this I went to sleep
Jack would become Eva's happy husband and would remain amidst the hurry duties of the eager world
sir Kensington oval is a very fine player said my wife
I remain there alone for many hours but I must acknowledge that before I left the chambers I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
this I felt was paid to me as being president of the Republic and I endeavored to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion but I cannot but feel that something was wanting to the Simplicity of my ordinary life
on arriving at home at my own residence I found that our Salon was filled with a brilliant company
as I spoke I made him a gracious bow and I think I showed him by my mode of address that I did not bear any Grudge as to my individual self
my wife on the spur of the moment managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner
it is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survived that period of Life at which men cease to work
and this plan was adopted to in order to extract from me a promise that I would depart in peace
and I have no one ready to whom I can give up the archives of the government
I shall be happy to take charge of them said sir Ferdinando
but it is surmise that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor
who are the habits of our people it is quite impossible
they of course must all be altar
when do you intend that the John bright shall start
today I shouted
you will carry out with you 100 men of the north-northwest Birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that if Mr never been be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
Lieutenant cross trees is a very Gallant officer
what will become of your gun where I had to kidnap you
the John bright is armed with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of Britain Eula should prevail
what worldwide iniquity such a speech is that discloses said I still turning myself to the captain for though I would have crushed them both by my words that have been possible my dislike centered itself on surf Ferdinando
then the Republic of Britain Eula was to be declared as non-existent and the British flag was to be exalted and a British Governor installed in the executive Chambers
I was to be taken away and carried to England or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage it mattered not which
one of us always remains on board while the other is unsure
you may be quite sure it's there I said Captain battle axe and that I can so use it as to half obliterate your town within 2 minutes of my return on board
you will allow me to suggest that he that that is a matter of opinion
were I to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion I should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
you propose to kidnap me I said
but what is the delegate Mission I asked
but in their selection of a constitution the Britain Euless have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprung their present difficulties
The Peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellency's knowledge
you hear what surf Ferdinando Brown has said replied captain battleaxe
the letter ran as follows
then said surf Ferdinando there's nothing for it but that we must take you with him
your power is sufficient I said
if you will give us your promise to meet Captain America at this time tomorrow we will stretch a point And Delay the departure of the John bright for 24 hours
there Came Upon me a sudden shock when I heard these words which exceeded anything which I had yet felt
sir I have it in command to inform your Excellency that you have been appointed governor of the Crown Colony which is called Britain EULA
it is a duty said I
in the death of which I dreamed could not alas
when this Captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to England I would retire to a small farm which I possessed at the farthest side of the island and they're in seclusion would I end my days
but your power is so Superior to any that I can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it
then there were three or four Leading Men of the community with their wives who are for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
what can I do now but just lay myself down and die
do you have received us with all that courtesy and Hospitality for which your character in England stand so high
Mr never Bend began the captain and I observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president it cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
how much of evil a real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
this she said was true hospitality and I am not sure that I did not agree with that
oh yes a Jack and I'm nowhere
not a doubt but had your Force been only double or trouble our own I should have found it my duty to struggle with you
the ladies in compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic or on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed or on the other
no doubt and process of time the ladies will follow
that is all quite true Mr never been said surf Ferdinando Brown
but I mean to have my Innings before long
you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then went ashore
of what Mrs never been had gone through in providing Birds beasts and Fishes not to talk of Tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success
I can afford to smile because I am absolutely powerless before you but I do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned I or rather we have been put down by Brute Force
he works me very hard he wanted to be beating me all the time
John Wesley kalmbach Jacob Taylor and Thomas Edward Skinner
a few years back one of their slaves a Coachmen was kept on the coach box one cold night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death in fact he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards
she was a large homely woman they were common white people with no reputation in the community
another case said John Wesley was a little girl have grown who was washing windows upstairs one day and luckily fell asleep in the window and in this position was found by her mistress in a rage the mistress hit her a heavy slap knocked her out of the window and she fell to the pavement and died in a few hours from the effects thereof
Esther's age and also the name of his master Jacob statement varied somewhat from the advertisement
substantially this was Jacob's unvarnished description of his master and mistress
the doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and fell down the stairs as she was coming down
from the manner in which she expressed himself with regard to Robert Holland no man in the whole range of his Recollections will be longer remembered than he his enthrallment while under Holland will hardly ever be forgotten
of this party Edward a boy of 17 called forth much sympathy he too was claimed by hollyn
it is hardly necessary to say more of them here
this was what did the Mischief so far as the running away was concerned
I'm starting I didn't know the way to come
as usual nothing was done in the way of punishment
I never knew of but one man who could ever please him

but much of the novels brooding power comes from Captain Nemo
this compulsion leads Nemo into ugly contradictions he's a fighter for Freedom yet all who bought his ship or imprisoned there for good he works to save lives both human and animal yet he himself creates a holocaust he detests imperialism yet he lays personal claim to the South Pole
in all the novel had a difficult gestation
and in this last action he falls into the classic sin of pride
he's swiftly punished
other subtleties occur inside each episode the textures sparkling with Witt information and insight

it's almost Beyond conjecture
and yet what a fine Gallant lad
yes we are certainly I replied evasively but after we make a detour
will be quite comfortable here I told him say
and so if I had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and I would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable Expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism
a route slightly less Direct that's all
not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of the journey
departing from 500,000 throats three cheers burst forth in succession
you say my friend it's an issue of the monster the notorious narwhal
we're leaving on the Abraham Lincoln
the wharves of Brooklyn and every part of New York bordering the East River were crowded with curiosity Seekers
in person welcome aboard professor your cabin is waiting for you
we have a commander who's game for anything
I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris France
I was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's mess
but we're going just the same
one of the sailors led me to the Afterdeck where I stood in the presence of a smart-looking officer who extended his hand to me
anyhow we'll leave instructions to ship the whole Menagerie to France
we'll deal with them later what
I asked for Commander Farragut
we don't know where it will take us
our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate I rushed the board
3 seconds before the arrival of JB Hobson's letter I know more dreams of chasing the Unicorn than of trying for the Northwest Passage
call say I called the third time going to say appeared
there was good reason to stop and think even for the world's most emotionless man
chapter 3 as Master wishes
I opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the Barbarossa and concierge at my heels I jumped into a carriage
Dave Master summon me he said entering
even so I had just returned from an arduous Journey exhausted and badly needing a rest
I wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
pack as much into my trunk as you can by traveling kit my suits shirts and socks don't bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry
he was a fanatic on formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it got to hire some
classifying was everything to him so he do nothing else well versed in the theory of classification he was poorly versed in its practical application and I doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a baleen whale
from rubbing shoulders with Scientists in our little Universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two
please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting that I had turned 40
but now nothing could hold me back
never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever China or the Congo no matter how far off it was
thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the Abraham Lincoln until it reached the Waters of the Hudson River at the tip of the long Peninsula that forms New York City
he went Here There and Everywhere in perfect contentment
call say Where's my manservant
the Mohicans started on his feet and shook his Shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
The Lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
the bear shook his Shaggy sides and then a well-known voice replied
the ingenious Hawkeye who recalled the Hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
the task will not be difficult to return David hesitating though I greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes
will the humans hear his groans
can these things be returned David breathing more freely as the truth began to Dawn upon him
405 of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas weary but close observers of the manner of their captive
delivered in a strong tone of ascent announced the gratification The Savage would receive and witnessing such an exhibition of weakness and an enemy so long hated and so much feared
come come returned Hawkeye I'm chasing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of His companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the Winds of the Heaven and the Sun have not bestowed now let us to business
there was something in his Heir in the manner that betrayed to the Scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
then as if satisfied of their safety the Scout left his position and slowly entered the place
the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow up on his brothers and take away their courage to continue David improving the hint he received they must stand further off
in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of balaam's ass to speak he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bear singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own Exquisite organs
they drew back a little from the entrance and motion to the supposed conjurer to enter
notwithstanding the high resolution of Hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur
my Pursuits are peaceful and my temper I humbly trust is greatly given to Mercy and love return David a little bit so direct and attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that I have ever forgotten my faith in the Lord even in the greatest Straits
if you are not then knocked on the head you're being a non-compete you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed
in his return to the camp his acute and practiced intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
but the bear instead of obeying maintained of the seated had taken and growled
it was silent and gloomy being tented solely by the captive and lighted by the dying Embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
so choose for yourself to make a rush or Terry here
but Hawkeye who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself into His companion
you'd better take the lead while I will put on the skin again and Trust to cunning for want of speed
bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf and this and more will I dare in his service
uncas occupied a distant Corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful widths
as soon as these dispositions were made the Scout turned to David and gave him his party instructions
if however they take your scalp as I trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and I will not forget the deed but Revenge it has become true Warriors and trusty friends
keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shouting which will serve to remind the Indians that you are not all together as responsible as men should be
well what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention
the delawares are children of the tortoise in the outstrip the deer
God bless you friend I do believe your scent is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts in the force of Temptation
the Delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the others features is he afraid
uncas who had already approached the door in Readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
then having a heavy sigh probably among the last you ever Drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what I would wish to practice myself as one without a cross of blood though it is not always easy to deal with an Indian as you would with a fellow Christian
what shall we do with the mangoes at the door they count six and the singer is as good as nothing
I greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and I have sought a goodly him can you lead me to him
the young man is in bondage and much I fear his death is decreed
the Scout who had left David at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
how old is David perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him I am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of Revenge
uncas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer are and ran along the whole extent of the village
it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding
the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of Triumph that the youth assumed
extinguished Brands were lying around a spring the awful of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees were evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with Keener eyes
and motioning with his hand he bathed him speak
a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
within a short range of the scares and not a sign of a trail have we crossed
if a rock or a rivulet or a bit of Earth harder than common severed The Links of the clue they followed the true eye of the Scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
Citrus pointing North and South at the evident marks of the broad Trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone toward the forest
distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of frequent and earnest
since the period of our tail the act of spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the Savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
the examination however resulted in no discovery
the whole party crowded to the spot where uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist eluvian
the Jews were suffered to Exhale and the sun had dispersed The Mists and was shedding a strong and clear Light in the Forest when The Travelers resumed their Journey
he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross the rivulet without a tentatively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its Waters
after proceeding a few miles the progress of Hawkeye who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
run back on Chris and bring me the size of the singers foot
we were more interested in the technical condition of the station that in the commercial park
we had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid
everything he is done has been aimed at the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
the others having been in operation Too Short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
it was specially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when a yield of 6 or 8 lbs to the horsepower was considered subject for congratulation
the street conductors were of the overhead Pole Line Construction add were installed by the construction company that had been organized by Edison to build an eclipse Central stations
in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of Edison Illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the Edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above 1,000 lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter
for some years it was not found feasible to operate Motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
I think he was perhaps more appreciative that I was of the discipline of the Edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the 4th before we started up
he weighed and reweighed the meter plates and pursued every line of Investigation imaginable but all in vain
the meter continued in general service during 1899 and probably up to the close of the century
meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three-wire system known in England as the Hopkinson both Dr John Hopkinson and Mr Edison being independent inventors at practically the same time
The Arc lamp installed outside a customer's premises or in a circuit for public Street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
the standard Edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the Central Station company for examination another set being substituted
in December 1888 Mr WJ Jenks read an interesting paper before the American Institute of electrical engineers on the 6 years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
Edison held at the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and Immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
they were later used as Reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edisonia but they remain in practically is good condition as one installed in 1883
the strong position held by the Edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three-wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting
he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact District of large cities
but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
the principal employed in the Addison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
hence the Edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify
the London plant was last temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than 3,000 lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings in the vicinity of Holborn Viaduct
the Paris plant like that at the Crystal Palace was a temporary exhibit
Mr Edison was a leader far ahead of the time
there was infinite skepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to Accurate registration
bear messier's Johnson & Hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in New York of which the story has just been told
then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and Mr Edison informed me that as a marine engine started before the ship left New York and continued running until it reached its Home Port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times
Edison had installed his historic first great Central Station system in New York on the multiple Arc system covered by his feeder and Main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two-wire system throughout of the tree kind
the Dynamo electric machine though small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until 1899 17 years
broad as the Prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is idiosyncratic opposed to loosen wasteful methods to plans of Empire that neglect the poor at the gate
unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed regulated than those available for his Dynamo and lamp Addison realize that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady
Edison was intolerant of sham and Shawty and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross-examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer
there seems no good reason for believing that it will change
it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charged storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current
owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly Universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers Edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
the problem was solved
why if we erect a station at The Falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a farmhouse the alternating currents in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
I heard a noise behind I turned and saw kaffir his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted it above his head as if to strike but I had the strength of ten men and I hurled him from me
I do not know I am dazed bewildered
in the light of the Moon I saw a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discolored
no words were spoken no language was uttered save that of wailing and hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and not in reality
but that is Casper's knife
onward set a distant voice
no sound broke the Stillness of the night
I know he had it this very evening
I had scarcely known when I had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke I looked at my hand
nothing more not even the risk to which it might be attached
what then a human hand large and shapely appear distinctly on the surface of the pond
set another voice which I recognized as vultures kaffir
the story of it's evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition I wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said
a sound of voices a flash of light
a feeling of freedom and I was awake where
what was that
I say you do know what this means and you must tell us
it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the Hand of Death
I awoke to Consciousness fighting at first it seemed as if I was fighting with the Phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was kaffir
a terrible thought flashed into my mind
perchance to Casper's death might serve him in good Stead
I had again been acting under the influence of this man's power
my overwrought nerve yielded at last
for some time after that I remembered nothing distinctly
wheelchair picked up something from the ground and looked at it
my position was too terrible
my tongue refused to articulate my power of speech left me
I remember saying have we been together
I can perceive love clearly enough
she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and were a brilliant future open for them
the count has thrown himself back on his seat leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remain thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and Restless limbs
I am convinced of what I say said the count
you will be frank with me I always am
in those very terms I even added more
it is annoyance then
this has indeed been a harassing day continue the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey
yes I need Repose many things have agitated me today both in mind and body when you return tomorrow I shall no longer be the same man
but in this friendly pressure Raul could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict
from the respect paid her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the Adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared in object of worship the queen mother gave the French the most affectionate reception France was her native country and she has suffered too much unhappiness in England for England to have made her forget France
thus it is that the honor of three is saved our country our masters and our own
the English forwarded to the French baskets of flowers of which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the arrival of the young princess the French in return invited the English to a supper which was to be given the next day
Concorde return to its place amidst the tents
but continued Rao not interrupted by this movement of his friend heaven be praised the French who are pronounced to be thoughtless in Indiscreet Reckless even are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bear on matters of such high importance
upon the large Square in front of the hotel the Shadows of the tents intersected by the Golden Moon beams formed as it were a huge Mosaic of Jet and yellow flag stones
the night was clear Starlet and Splendid The Tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
Raglan watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers listen to the loud and uncivil Slumbers of Mana Camp who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead of his Violet suit
can you imagine why Buckingham has been so violent I suspect
it is you who are mistaken Raul I have read his distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day
then she suddenly remark
in my pocket money is getting low again and you have any left as usual
do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing
surface dust at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish
yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room
I thought we were stumped again when I first saw that picture but it's been of some use after all
they say illumination by candlelight is the prettiest in the world
he makes it sort of Cozier
now let's dust the furniture in pictures
why it's Goliath as usual they both cried peering
forgetting all their weariness they seize their candles and Scurry through the house finding on occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner
isn't he the greatest for getting into odd corners
oh let him come along she urged I do love to see him about that old house
now what is the sense of it two innocent babies like that
the poor little things cried Cynthia think of them having been turned to the wall all these years
The Lure proved too much for him and he came sporting after it as fiscally as a young kitten much to Cynthia's Delight when she caught sight of him
well I'm convinced that the boarded-up house mystery happened not earlier than April 16th 1861 and probably not much later
Goliath makes another discovery
this thought however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair
smuggling in the house cleaning paraphernalia into the cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for Cynthia had added a whisk broom and dustpan to the outfit
there were certainly no near the solution of their problem
the twin brother did something she didn't like and she turned his picture to the
remind me terribly and besides I'd like to see what this lovely Furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it good scheme
where in the world is it query choice
but Joyce had not been listening all at once she put down her Candle on the table and faced her companion
will come in here this afternoon with old clothes on and have a regular house cleaning
hers happen to be on the same frame too but she evidently didn't care about it
now what have you to say Cynthia Sprague
it can't hurt anything I'm sure for we won't disturb things at all
each of us is lashed to some part of the raft
there's a heavy storm coming on I cried pointing towards the horizon
those clouds seemed as if they were going to crush the sea
the waves rise above our heads
he nods his consent
they seem to be we are lost but I am not sure
we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disc of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches hands who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle Who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it
a suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs
at noon the violence of the storm Red Devils
here it comes there it Glides now it is up the Ragged stump of the masked that's it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skims the Powder Magazine horrible
the fireball half of it white half Azure blue and the size of a 10 inch shell move slowly about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity as if whip round by the force of the Whirlwind
the raft Bears on steel to the southeast
from the undersurface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lured Light Electric matter is in continual Evolution from their component molecules the gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture for innumerable Columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
the weather if we may use the term will change before long
we suffer stifling pains
the Rawlings become lost in the distance
monsters
the atmosphere is charged with vapors pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline Waters
I refer to the thermometer it indicates the figure is obliterated
is the atmospheric conditioning having once reached its density to become final
the electric light can scarcely penetrate to the dense curtain which is dropped over the theater on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
the wind never lose but to acquire increase strength the vast Bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
it piled up Vapors contest in the water and the air put in the violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the Mist Rouses itself into a whirlwind
that will be the safest no no never
the atmosphere is evidently charged in surcharged with electricity
on the masked already I See the Light play of a laminate St Elmo's Fire the outstretched cell catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead
the air is heavy the sea is calm
from time to time a fleece tuft of Miss with yet some gleaming light left upon it drops down upon the dance floor of grey and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable Mass
but if we have now cease to Advanced why do we get leave that sell loose which at the first shock of a tempest may capsize us in a moment
it must be as wide as the Mediterranean or the Atlantic and why not
The Horizon seems extremely distant
those huge creatures attack each other with the greatest animosity
its jaw is enormous and according to naturalist it is armed with no less than $182 teeth
Saturday August 15th the sea unbroken all around no land in sight
truly the sea is of infinite width
all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that I am well his Nature has resumed its way
these thoughts agitated me all day and my imagination scarcely calm down after several hours sleep
I shudder as I recall these monsters to my remembrance
you seem anxious my uncle I said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye anxious
he called the sea upon and I lost voice taking a little sale
the shadow of the Wrath was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
but there seemed no reason to fear
we are losing time and the fact is I have not come all this way to take a little sale upon a pond on a raft
Sunday August 16th
one might be with less reason than now
I am not complaining that the rate is slow but that the sea is so wide
nothing new weather unchanged the wind freshens
Tuesday August 18th
therefore don't talk to me about views and Prospects
I take this is my answer and I leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience
during his watch I slept
the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of 20 fathoms
2 hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke
two monsters only recreating all this commotion and before my eyes are too reptiles of the Primitive world
I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal and as large as a man's head

the Lagoon had been level with the dikes a week ago and now
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
the years of the days of her dying were 10
where was the use of imagining
open the sick room Zora lay on the little white bed
the net and Webb of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in Dumb speechless Terror against some mighty grasping that stroll for her life was gnarled and creeping fingers but now it lasts weekly she opened her eyes and question
aren't you hurried until sweeping down to the Lagoon and the island low the cotton lay before her
she had been born within its borders within its borders she had lived and grown and within its border she had met her love
for a while she lay in her chair and happy dreamy pleasure it's sun and bird and tree

he sat down week bewildered and one thought was uppermost Sora
she rolls with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
the chair was empty but he knew

he darted through the trees and paused a tall man strongly but slimy made
he gazed about perplexed astonished
the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it Flames like a sunrise over him and left him in burning Wonder
ah the swamp the cruel SW
for one long moment he paused stupid a game with utter amazement then lean dizzily against the tree
he splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he near the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree Bridge
the world was water veiled in Mists
nine of a sudden at midday the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel the Earth Steam
then he looked down the Lagoon was dry
she was so strange in human a creature
he started as a thought he hurried forth sadly
perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping

the vanderpool's were sure this and the Englishman instancing India became quite eloquent Mrs Gray was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest scrutiny before being allowed much education and ask for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them

and the one Oracle having spoken she sat down in the same sort of abstraction again beside Dorcas and she looked full in her cousin's eyes
thank you Rachel my cousin Rachel my only friend

she spoke with a sudden energy which part took a fear and passion and flushed her thin cheek and made her language eyes Flash

at dinner Lake was easy and amusing
more suddenly and noisily than the humor of the joke seems quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on Lake but the Gallant Captain did not seem to perceive it and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to Mrs Dorothy only remarking
do you know Lake oh I really can't tell but he'll soon Tire of country life
I'm glad you like it says Wilder chuckling benignantly on it over his shoulder

Ojo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it all together in a golden dish where he mixed it with a Golden Spoon
no I forgot all about the brains exclaim the woman
gold is the most common metal in the Land of Oz and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable
their contents at all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each Kettle a few grains of fine white powder
ask the voice in scornful accents
she ran to her husband's side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire
I think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in a servant
dear me what a chatterbox you're getting to be Unk or Mark the magician who is pleased with the compliment
it truly is asserted the magician
I now use them as ornamental statuary in my garden
he wore blue silk stockings blue knee pants with gold buckles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braided with gold
Ojo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life
a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth all neatly sewed together
sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
we're traveling reply to Joe and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves
his hat had a peaked crown with a flat brim and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that Tangled when he moved
at 1:10 to Great fireplace in which a blue log was Blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate
for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of Oz in which they lived
instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turnover tops and is blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid
the woman seem thoughtful
we have come from a fire lonely place than this a lonelier place
at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the Gilligans the path divided
he knew it would take them to the house of the Crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbor
and you must be Ojo the Unlucky she added
no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
I am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home
unconnected the door of the house and a chubby Pleasant faced woman dressed all in blue opened it and created the visitors with a smile
when they were outside UNG simply latch the door and started up The Path
I think the next glass cat the magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and they proved of some use to us
then they started on again and 2 hours later came inside of the house of Dr pipped
all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon Unk and Oho sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
the first lot we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
I'm afraid I don't know much about the Land of Oz
UCI I've lived all my life without monkey The Silent One and there was no one to tell me anything
get that task was not so easy as you may suppose
but first I will tell you that for many years I have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cook the meals and wash the dishes
I will show you what a good job I did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment I am pleased to say it is nearly done you see I am making It For My Good Wife margelot who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own
that is one reason you are Ojo the Unlucky said the woman in sympathetic tone
when I found it I said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor hottie as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
at the Emerald City where are princess ozma lives green is the popular color
I think I must show you my Patchwork girl said Mark a lot laughing at the boys astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
you must know said margelot when they were all seated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mom be the witch who used to live in the country of the Gilligan's to the north of here

it was a pain to see them and a sword like pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness

whose feet are as the feet of hearts and underneath the Everlasting Arms
they're piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and was idle for him to tell himself that they're humble and contrite Hearts it might be paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
soon the whole Bridge was trembling and resounding
idle and in bittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandant of Love made us not to love our neighbor as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love
it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their Gates stripped of his pride beaten and in Beggars weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
the pride of that damn image brought back to his mind the Dignity of the office he had refused
he set off abruptly for the bull walking rapidly lest his father's shrill whistle might call him back and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe

but in such a case Ms Milner's election of a husband shall not direct mine

what can you mean by that Miss Woodley you talk mysteriously
is she not afraid that I will thwart her inclinations
Miss Milner's health is not good
Miss Woodley was two little versed in the subject to know this would have been not to love at all at least not to the extent of breaking through engagements and all the various obstacles that still mitigated against their Union

the modest fellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy achievement it might be for a book or for the skillful management of some great newspaper or for some daring Expedition like that of Lieutenant strain or Dr Kane
it is such a noble ambition that it is a Pity it has usually such a shallow Foundation
and he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for a dignified entrance into the literary world
what's Philip did afford it and he wrote thinking his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought to fail
Lawson to him well enough as a science but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worthwhile to go to law and all the clients who stopped with this new Clerk and the ante room of the law office where he was writing Philip invariably advised to settle no matter how but settle greatly to the disgust of his employer who knew that Justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attendant fees
he had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the DoorKing convention then in session make a sketch of the men and women on the platform and take it to the editor of the daily Grapevine and see what he could get a line for it
he was unable to decide exactly what it should be
sometimes you thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preach the gospel of repentance and it even crossed his mind that it would be Noble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted region where the date palm grows and the nightingale's voice is in tune and the Bulbul sings on the off night

Branson Missouri somewhere on the frontier I think we'll get a map
he wanted to begin at the top of the ladder
Philip there for red diligently in the after Library planned literary works that should compel attention and nurse his genius
I was afraid it was near her home
he well knew the Perils of the frontier The Savage state of society the lurking Indians and the dangers of fever
he knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter
the night was spent in packing up and writing letters for Philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends
the two young men who were by this time full of the adventure went down to the Wall Street office of Henry's uncle and had a talk with that Wily operator
I will practice it
I have not asked him Ruth replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers
is thy father willing they should go away to a school of the world's people
and besides supposedly does learn medicine
Ruth was glad to hear that Philip had made a push into the world and she was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him
I heard Father tell cousin Abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now

and then there was Broad Street
and he won't go why should I
he doesn't say exactly what it is said Ruth a little dubiously but it's something about land and railroads and the nose father that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how in a new country
father these are just to fill up he's going into business
it has occupied mother a long time to find the Shoppes the exact shade for her new bonnet
Ruth asked the Enthusiast if they would like to live in such a sounding Mausoleum with its great halls and echoing rooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of anybody
there certainly was no into it and even Ruth was Philadelphia enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end or architectural Point upon which the weary I could rest
why should I rest and be stupid and sit in an action because I am a girl
mother I am going to study medicine
Margaret Bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity

but neither Saint Gerard nor Broad Street neither wonders of the meant nor the glories of the hall where the ghosts of our fathers sit always signing the Declaration impress the visitor so much as the splendors of the Chestnut Street windows and the bargains on 8th Street

the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
without going to any such Extreme as this we can easily see on reflection how vast and influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action and mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impress upon the mind
vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
they are chiefly formed from combinations of The Impressions made in childhood

that is comparatively nothing
at the farther end of the largest haul a table was set with golden cups and Golden Plates in Long rows
he still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's Cottage
he darted like an arrow through all the Halls down all the stairs and across the yard
4 lake is not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap
and all his brothers and sisters stood around and listened with their mouths open
but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's Golden Crown he said that Anders was a stupid
if you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
no my little son she said
Anders face grew red
and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted it herself and everybody wants to get it away from me
with one jump Anders got out of his chair
but his mother hugged him close
but Anders cared nothing about that
he only shook his head
well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed
he made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumbfounded I can tell you when he saw it was nobody but Anders
cant read wav file
now this night was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and Anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jackknife
he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jackknife
that is a very fine cap you have he said
but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to take it off
I'm going to the court ball answered Anders
and she took Anders hand and walked with him at the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and through the Magnificent Halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly like to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition
sing that I am so fine I may as well go and visit the king
the princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses and she let Anders sit in a golden Chair by her side
on huge silver platters were pyramids of Tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled and glittering decanters
yes why not thought Anders
do you have an idea of these conversations I will report one of them in full
now Delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendancy over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
do such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
Della had a young sister named Maria and a cousin whose name was Jane
I am very glad
so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and Round by a circuitous route to The Piazza
Delia came to the Parlor and with an air of great mystery beckon the children aside and said to them in a whisper leave and Ella and Rosalie here and don't say a word to them
you have come and Della and Della was the name of Jane's doll to make Rosalie a visit
said she pointing to the play things
I expect you have been a very good girl and Ella since you were here last
then turn into Jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has she been a good girl Jane
put these playthings all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything about you leaving them out
they were now playing with their dolls in the Parlor
for instance one day the children had been playing upon the Piazza with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the Piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that Mary can no longer watch the expression of her continents goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction on her face at the Ingenuity and success of her little artifice
so you will be a good girl I know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you
if you should not be a good girl but should show signs of making us any trouble I shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
the mother in managing the case in this way realize partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection
by reason and affection
as the chase drives away Mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and Ill humor Surge and swell among those delegate organizations on which the structure and development of the Soul so closely dependent doing perhaps and irreparable injury
to suppose that the object of this work is to Aid in affecting such a substitution is that is entirely to mistake its nature and Design
the three modes of management
but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if Mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection cannot be overrated
did you look at these papers on the table
you haven't seen any of them no sir
oh I would not venture to say sir
but I have occasionally done the same thing at other times
I really don't think he knew much about it Mr Holmes
I do not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
he was still suffering from the sudden disturbance of The Quiet routine of his life
only for a minute or so
let us hear the suspicions I will look after the proofs
100 likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
my scholar has been left very poor but he is hardworking and industrious he will do well
the top floor belongs to Mi McLaren
at your disposal
you left him in a chair you say which Chair by the window there
cant read wav file
homes held out a small chip with the letters n n and the space of Clearwood after them you see
the men entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table
above or three students one on each story
I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no I see nothing
how long would it take him to do that using every possible contraction a quarter of an hour not less
as a matter of fact he could not said Psalms for I entered by the side door
Watson I have always done you an injustice there are others
Holmes had it out on his open Palm in the glare of the electric light
I'm afraid there are no signs here said he
one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
there is no opening except the one pain center learned guide
Holmes turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor hello what is this
the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that I was out and had entered to look at the papers
the proof was in three long slips I had left them all together
is Holmes through the curtain I was aware from some little rigidity and an alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck crane he looked into the room
and they are all in for this examination yes
I was absent rather more than an hour
a broken tip of lead was lying there also
I gave him a little Brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while I made him most careful examination of the room
I had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
I understand you to say that there are three students who use the stair and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
not only this but on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay with Specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
the only duplicate which existed so far as I knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for 10 years and who's honesty is absolutely above suspicion
the moment I looked at my table I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
above all things I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
so it seems to me
without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homeland tidiness he was an uncomfortable man
my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street
I was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
I will endeavor in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
to the best of my belief they were rolled up
then he tossed it down and sees the next
who was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very harried Retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
I had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
how came you to leave the key in the door
anyone in the room could get out yes sir
the Indian I also thought nothing of
and one more this morning
in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the Dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship
when I approached your room I examined the window
on the palm where three little pyramids of black doughy clay
he could examine the papers in his own office
it is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action
I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
well well don't trouble to answer listen and see that I do you know Injustice
look at that he held out his hand
I think so you have formed a conclusion
he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come
just close the door sit homes
we want to know Mr Gilchrist how you an honorable man ever came to commit such an action is that of yesterday
you know him I think so
yes my dear Watson I have solved the mystery
come come sit Holmes kindly it is human to err and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous Criminal
no sir certainly not
if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private Court martial
for a moment Gilchrist with upraised hand tried to control his Rising features
no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are aware with several sharp spikes
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
he put his shoes on the table
I have a letter here Mr songs which I wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
have I told the truth Mr Gilchrist
if Mr soames saw them the game was up
gloves said the young man
suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible Escape
it would be clear to you from what I have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
no good my dear Watson
no names please sit Holmes as we knocked at Gilchrist door
the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but Shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignation
it was the Indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind
why banister the servant what's his game in the matter
there was no man sir
has trouble blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner
he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
I entered and I took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table
that is very important in homes
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
I will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings goodbye
of course he did not realize that it was I who was knocking but nonetheless his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious
no one less than that would have a chance
the foul mouth fellow at the top
you don't seem to realize the position
tomorrow is the examination
he is the one with the worst record
the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow to delicate lines of dark gray to find the outer curve and one little quivering Touch of white drawers the inner edge of the mandible
it must remember be one or the other
it may be that a great colorless will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice but loud or low The Virtue is in both cases always in refinement never in loudness
Danny comes to the beak of it
but in this vignette copied from Turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly
some of the touches indeed when the tent has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge
but now here is the subject of which you will wonder at first why Turner drew it at all
it has no Beauty whatsoever no specialty of picturesqueness and all its lines are cramped and poor
does the head of a parrot with a little flower in his Beak from a picture of carpaccio's one of his series of the life of St George
they are beyond all other works that I know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favorite choice and time of day being either Dawn or Twilight and even their brightest sunsets produce chiefly out of gray paper
only there are two sorts of cloud and Fire
the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such missed or faintness as shall be delightful and I have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
the unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as Kiara Securus
you will find me continually speaking of four men tissue Holbein Turner and tin tarat in almost the same terms
do not therefore think that the gothic school is an easy one
well then last here is Turner's Greek School of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and Fire
by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the Cure oscuras devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force and one thing unseparated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact you are producing Jewelers work rather than pictures
that a Styles restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct Hue side by side
it will be well for you if you join not with those who instead of kites fly Falcons who instead of obeying the last words of the great Cloud Shepherd to feed his sheep live the lives how much less than vanity of the werewolf in the Gear Eagle

there's one and there's another The Dudley and the Flint
you know I've just been telling you how this school of materialism and Clay involved itself at last and cloud and Fire
the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and electron figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of Gothic or any other school
in all of the gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially Distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid propose of classic art
nothing will be more precious to you I think in the Practical study of art then the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter
he knows them both
for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a Cock Robin is to be read and of a grass plot to be green and the best School of Art is an instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of Light which you can only seize by Precision of instantaneous touch
Exquisite order and Universal with eternal life and light this is the faith and effort of the schools of Crystal and you may describe and complete their work quite literally by taking any verses of Chaucer in his tender mood and observing how he insists on the clearness and brightness first and then on the order
but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek and Imagination
it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the Tranquility of temper and Felicity of Faith necessary for Noble purest painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the Felicity and piece of practical life

now you will see in these studies at the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonize with the other Hughes it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that I am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all around it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell is Jewels if they are graded justly
the colorist says first of all as my delicious parakeet was Ruby so this nasty Viper shall be black and then is the question can I round him off even though he is black and make him slimy and yet springy and close down clotted like a pool of black blood on the Earth all the same
every line in which the master traces it even worse seemingly negligent is lovely and sit down with a meditative calmness which makes these two etchings capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of Holbein or
in both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature those suffering is still dignified and beautiful
you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scale you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him
some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
a further stage is recognition
recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of Association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
in this case as in most others what may be taken a certain in advance is rather vague
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the Judgment this is familiar
but I do not think such an inference is warranted
Simmons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly Define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to Mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations May deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
they give laws According to which images of past occurrence has come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidence of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe
It Is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well-known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what I am experiencing now by certain Links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at First Sight more correct to Define recognition as I have seen this before then as this has existed before
thus if I recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which I recognized it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world
of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
there may be a specific feeling which could be called The Filling of pastinas especially where immediate memory is concerned
in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that can occur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event
whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions
I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered before such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be holy habit that enables me to do this
I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the 13th lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole Enterprise
what is called perception differs from Sensation by the fact that the Sensational ingredients bring up habitual Associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
some images like some Sensations feel very familiar While others feel strange
all that I am doing is to use its logical ten ability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may vary probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
there is no logical impossibility and the hypothesis that the world's sprang into being 5 minutes ago exactly as a thin was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
the behaviorist who attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record
familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees
in an image of a well-known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar Parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
determining whether two or more Allied forms ought to be ranked to species or varieties naturalists are practically Guided by the following considerations namely the amount of difference between them and whether such differences relate to few or many points of structure and whether they are a physiological importance but more especially whether they are constant

I took five great bracelets of gold from our treasure chest and gave them to him
my men pounded the table with their fists

then I drank half of the horn full and set the rest to cross the fire to the farmer he took it and smiled saying
I painted the eyes red for anger

Envy hatred malice in Uncharted illness are never so essentially detestable to my mind as when they are animated by the sense of propriety and work under the surface but for my interest in Naomi and my other interests in the little love looks which I now and then surprised passing between her and Ambrose I should never have sat through that supper

then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first Timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of men and then I shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the last Athenian citizens of whom the Egyptian records spoke

some poems of Solomon were recited by the boys
listen then Socrates to a tale of Silence who being the friend of Trophies by great-grandfather told it to my grandfather critias and he told me
but in Egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered forever in our temples
and what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark
4 in the times before the great flood Athens was the greatest and best of cities and did the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of Heaven
Solomon marveled and desire to be informed of the particulars
the subject was a very Noble one he described the most famous action in which the Athenian people were ever engaged
I will give to me is approves I approve
observe again what cure the law took in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the Deep things of the world and applying them to the use of men
I will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers
and therefore to you I Turn To Me is citizen of Lakers who are at once a philosopher in a statement and to you Creedence whom all Athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to her more critics who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
9000 years have you laughed since she found it yours and 8,000 since she founded ours as our animals record

many laws exist Among Us which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time
put in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
he could write in one style but not in another in the Greek language has not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
play Joe had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art
there is a want of flow and often a defect of Rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of a position in more of repetition than occurs in Plato's earlier writings
the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with men only as one among the animals
we do not know how Plato would have arranged his own dialects or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
enhance we find the same sort of clumsiness in the Timaeus of Plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius
in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
he acknowledges the Perpetual flux like an exaggerated he asserts the predominance of mine although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposed to the mystery of the world to be contained in a number
but he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and Mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great and impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
there is no danger of the modern commentators on the Timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neoplasms
mini it's not all the elements of the preso critic philosophy are included in the Timmy is
the fancies of the neoplatonic interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the Christian era and is not holy extinct in our own day
but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of Plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
it is probable that the relation of the idea is to God or of God to the world what's differently conceived by him at different times of his life
nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he's using words after his accustomed manner
they were absorbed in his Theology and were under the Dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
in the supposed depths of this dialogue the new planets found hidden meanings in connections with the Jewish and Christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quiet at variance with the spirit of Plato
put Play-Doh has not the same Mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the features or symposium
he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the Heavens to men from astronomy to physiology he confuses a rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals Birds fishes
the style in plan of the team is differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogues
the influence which the Timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
I will ask the least imaginable but I must have something
Alexander lean forward and warmed his hands before The Blaze
Alexander did not sit down
I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something Splendid was going to turn up
Bartley bent lowered over the fire
I must know about you
she pushed him toward the big Chair by the fire and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the Hearth her knees drawn up to her chin laughing like a happy little girl
I'll do anything you wish me to Bartley she said tremendously
she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash
I thought it might be Sister Kate or cousin Mike would be happening along
Alexander paced up and down the hallway buttoning and unbuttoning his Overcoat until she returned and took him up to heal his living room
Hilda watched him from the corner trembling and scarcely breathing Dark Shadows growing about her eyes
but it's worse now it's unbearable
the room was empty when he entered
he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
she blushed and smiled and followed his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
please tell me one thing Bartley at least tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy
yes yes she hurried pulling her head gently away from him
stop at Queenstown the tedious passage of the mercy were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
I can't stand seeing you miserable
the world is all there just as it used to be but I can't get added anymore
I understand Bartley I was wrong
weren't you happy then at all
she pressed his hand gently and gratitude
yes Hilda I know that he said simply
I get nothing but misery out of either
she closed her eyes and took a deep breath as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days
but I didn't know you've only to tell me now
what I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again no matter how often I come no matter how hard I beg
he moved uneasily and his chair creaked
Alexander grown I'm meant to but somehow I couldn't
what am I to do
he took a roughly in his arms do you know what I mean
but why didn't you tell me when you were here in the summer
keep away if you wish when have I ever followed you
it was my self I was defying Hilda
when did you come Bartlett and how did it happen you haven't spoken a word
I got in about 10 minutes ago
Hilda's face quivered but she whispered yes I think it must have been
Alexander Rose and shook himself angrily yes I know I'm cowardly
who's tortured each other enough for tonight
I don't cry don't cry he whisper
the sight of you Bartley to see you living and happy and successful can I never make you understand what that means to me
you see loving someone as I love you mix the whole world different
Bartley bent over and took her in his arms kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes
and then you came back not caring very much but it made no difference
her hair is still like flax and her blue eyes are just like a baby and she has the same three freckles on her little nose and talks about going back to her abandonment
lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them I fancy
when Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening Marie the pretty little French girl met him at the door and conducted him upstairs
how Jolly it was being young Hilda
they asked him to come to see them in Chelsea and they spoke very tenderly of Hilda
don't I though I'm so sorry to hear it how did your son turn out
it's really too warm in this room to sing don't you feel it
nonsense of course I can't really sing except the way my mother and grandmother did before me
there are a few changes in the old quarter
Hilda was very nice to him and he sat on the edge of his chair flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar
I should never have asked you if Molly had been here for I remember you don't like English cookery
there was Watercress soup and soul and a delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and Truffles and two small rare ducklings and artichokes and a dry yellow round wine of which Bartley had always been very fond
there's nothing else that looks so jolly
I haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is
have you been in Paris much these late years
those fellows are all very loyal even main hall
Valdosta you see
thank you but I don't like it so well as this
the strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both
they were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money God give you a happy love
Alexander clinched the two hands at his sides
I think we did she answered to merely
he felt a Tremor run through the Slender yellow figure in front of him
I've managed to save something every year and that was helping my three sisters now and then and Tiding poor cousin Mike over Bad seasons
it's not particularly rare she said but some of it was my mother's
Bartley leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear you are giving me a chance yes
nor are Frank's but just our youth
come we'll have our coffee in the other room and you can smoke
it was very jolly he murmured lazily as Marie came in to take away the coffee
there just in front
Alexander went over and opened the window for her
Bartley started when Hilda rang the little Bell beside her dear me why did you do that
do you remember that first walk we took together in Paris
he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it's soft and Misty see how white the stars are
have I told you about my new play
when she finished Alexander shook himself out of a reverie
for a long time neither hilden or Bartley spoke
after that it was easy to forget actually to forget
I shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it with me now
she considered for a moment and then said no I think not the way I'm glad you asked me
homely and sensible and something utterly wild and Daft
somewhere back in the beginning
even while a kind of Rapid excitement was tingling through him
she must care about the theater a great deal more than she used to
after all we were awfully Young
I'm glad she's held her own sense
she doesn't take up with anybody you know

the hawk sat upon the branch and watched his Quarry swimming beneath the surface
all about him was a tumult of bright and broken color scattered and Broad splashes
the Merganser had a crested head of iridescent green black a broad collar of lustrous white black back black and white Wings white belly sides finally penciled in black and white and the rest of Rich chestnut red streaked with black
almost instantly he was forced to the top
but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls Hawks and Eagles he had no rending claw
but at this point in the Rapids it was impossible for him to stay down
straight away in the hot glided from his perch and started after him
his feet were red his long narrow beak with its Sawtooth edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red
am I going to have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal
the hawk a lighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised
like his unfortunate little cousin the teal he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for The Refuge of some dark overhanging Bank deep fringed with weeds where the Dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him
but such was his kindness that even while the wide flukes of his engorged victim were still sticking out of the corners of his beak his Fierce red eyes were once more appearing downward into the torrent in search of fresh prey
in fact he had just finished it the last of the Trout's tale had just vanished with a spasm down his strange gullet when the baffled hook caught sight of him and swooped
once fairly a wing however he wheeled and made back Hurley for his perch
but suddenly Street and Swift is a diving Cormorant he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface
the cat growled softly picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it
the great Hawk fouled Hurley to retrieve his prey from the ground
but as before the leaping waves of the Rapids were too much for his pursuer and he was able to Flap his way onward in a cloud of foam will Doom hung low above his head get hesitated to strike
where the waves for an instant sink they came closer but not quite within grasping reach
in despair he hurled himself downward too soon
the hawk embittered by the loss of his first Quarry had become as dogged and pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived
he had a lot of line out and the place was none to free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was feeding
then the leader parted from the line
the drag upon his beak and the light check up on his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling
the last drop fly as luck would have it caught just in the corner of the Hawks angrily open beak hooking itself firmly
but this frequenter of the heights of are for all his Savage Valor was troubled at the leaping waves in the tossing foam of these mad Rabbids he did not understand them
as he flew his down reaching clutching Talons were not half a yard above the fugitives head
at the sudden sharp sting of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank

brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has invoked the spirit but buy some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
they were now illuminated by the morning Radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of Earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
Hester Prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of airing on the side of undo severity
Pearl was a born Outcast of the infantile world
Hester could only account for the child's character and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while Pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of Earth
Hester was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a closed pressure and Earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that Pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
it was a look so intelligent get inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that Hester could not help questioning at such moments whether Pearl was a human child
this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly expressed the various properties of her inner life
how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became everyday more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering Sunshine over the tiny features of this child
Pearl Saul engaged intently but never sought to make acquaintance
if spoken to she would not speak again
God as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same Dishonored bosom to connect her parents forever with the race and Descent of Mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
the child had a native Grace which does not invariably coexist with faultless beauty it's a tire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very Garb that precisely became it best
Hester Prynne less with hope than apprehension
as to any other kind of discipline whether address to her mind or heart little Pearl might or might not be within its Reach In accordance with the Caprice that ruled the moment
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrote out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid Ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow Tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were lattice Windows the wooden shutters to close over them at need
lifting the iron Hammer that hung at the portal Hester Prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor's Bond servants a Freeborn Englishman but now a 7 years slave
but in truth Pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had has their contrived so perfectly to represent the Scarlet Letter in her appearance
it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint Taste of the age which have been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
it was The Scarlet Letter in another form The Scarlet Letter endowed with life
we have spoken of pearls rich and luxuriant Beauty a beauty that shown with deep and Vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy Brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to Black
she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to Quake within them
yay has honorable worship is within but he hath a Godly minister or two with him and likewise a leech
Hester Prynne went one day to the mansion of Governor Bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of State for the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential Place among the colonial magistracy
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled Hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the Affairs of the settlement
you may not see his worship now
the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a Fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature
on the table and token that the sentiment of Old English Hospitality had not been left behind stood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which had Hester or Pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draft of Ale
with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of Ferris State in his native land
at that epic of pristine Simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and a far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of Hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of State
little Pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering front desk piece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate
Pearl sing the rose bushes began to cry for a red rose and would not be pacified
I see you here look look
Pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the Vista of a Garden Walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery
but Pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
come there for and let us fling mud at them
in truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
but the proprietor appeared all ready to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the Atlantic in a hard soil and amid the clothes struggle for subsistence the native English taste for ornamental gardening
there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the Reverend Mr Blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological percentage who rides through our early annals seeded on the back of a ball
in other words these three men took down the lectures which Luther addressed to his students in the course of Galatians and Roar prepared the manuscript for the printer
it presents like no other of Luther's writings the central thought of Christianity the justification of The Sinner for the sake of Christ merits alone
much later when a friend of his Was preparing an addition of all his Latin Works he remarked to his home Circle if I had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have Doctrine my Galatians for instance
the word of our God shall stand forever
a word should now be said about the origin of Luther's commentary on Galatians
but the essence of Luther's lectures is there
it was written in Latin
the work had to be condensed
the Lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do Luke 2
the condition is that I will be permitted to make Luther talk American streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the Lutheran Church actually to read Luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to Americans
we want you to help us some leading work of Luther's for the general American Market will you do it
let us begin with that his commentary on Galatians
the undertaking which seems so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved the most difficult one and at times became oppressive
The Vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins
Grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
do bestow peace and Grace lies in the province of God who alone can create these blessings the Angels cannot
that Christ is very God is a parent and that Paul describes to him Divine Powers equally with the father as for instance the power does the dispense Grace and peace
the greeting of the Apostle is refreshing
the greatness of the ransom Christ the son of God indicates this
otherwise Paul should have written Grace from God the father and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ
the world brings this a pernicious Doctrine
experience proves this
the Aryans took price for a noble imperfect creature Superior even to the angels because by him God created heaven and earth
at the same time Paul confirms our Creed that Christ is very God
to do so is to lose God altogether because God becomes intolerable when we seek to measure into comprehend his infinite Majesty
was it not enough to say from God the Father
we are to hear Christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
however the grace and peace of God will
did not Christ himself say I am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
when you argue about the nature of God apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
men should not speculate about the nature of God
the class seems Superfluous on first sight
wherever the means of Grace are found there is the holy church even though Antichrist Reigns there
so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the Apostle verse 3
these converters of the righteousness of Christ resist the father and the son and the works of them both
Paul an apostle not of men Etc
they remain Divine regardless of men's opinion
in God the Father who raised him from the dead
this is no sinful Pride it is Holy Pride
these means cannot be contaminated
Paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own phrase but to the praise of God
they do not go where the enemies of the Gospel predominate they go where the Christians are
in this whole episode Paul treats of the resurrection of Christ
I did not then realize the importance of the ministry
I know nothing of the doctrine of Faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
by his resurrection Christ won the victory over law sin flesh World devil death hell and every evil
why do they not invade the Catholic provinces and preach their Doctrine to Godless princess Bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of God
in all the bedroom which are with me
not all the Galatians have become perverted
we look for that reward which I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man
first
call Kim later in his beneath us
when I was a young man I thought Paul was making too much of his call
is spoils ones best work
he was the last to turn to Christ
this should go far and shutting the mouse to the false apostles
the call is not to be taken lightly
in every way they sought to undermine the authority of Saint Paul
they said to the Galatians you have no right to think highly of Paul
for a person to possess knowledge is not enough
although the Brethren with me are not Apostles like myself yet they are all of One mind with me think right and teach as I do
Paul declares that the false apostles were called or sent neither by men nor by man
do you suppose that God for the sake of a few Lutheran Heretics would disown his entire church
the terms of Grace and peace are common terms with Paul and are now pretty well understood
Grace be to you in peace from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ
indeed he persecuted the Church of Christ for a long time
if he calls ministers through the agency of men or he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles
against these boasting false Apostles Paul boldly defends his Apostolic Authority in Ministry
the most they could claim is that they were sent by others
he mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by God
is the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of Christ should exalt his office in order to gain Authority among men
he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes met fastened upon him
he never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle
this attitude is universal in particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
not gold or silver or partial Lambs or an angel but himself what for
Embrace him and forget about the nature of God
underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness before our sins
on the other hand we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair
this passage then Bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin
since Christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts
this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
this attitude Springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by Good Works that we must present ourselves unto God with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that Christ was given for our sins
Paul answers the man who was named Jesus Christ and the Son of God gave himself for our sins
we think that by some little work or Merit we can dismiss him
Paul sticks to his
Muhammad also speaks highly of Christ
but we are careless we make light of sin
how may we obtain remission of our sins

he had a good appetite could tell a good story without laughing was celebrated for his witty repartee and his sociable manners but he spent his life at home seldom going out and seeing hardly anyone because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least 20 cats with which he would amuse himself all day
his housekeeper had the management of everything she never allowed him to be in need of anything and she gave no account of his money which she kept all together because he never asked her to render any accounts

she was honorably buried in the church of Saint Xavier without the slightest opposition from the venerable priest who far from sharing the anti-christian intolerance of the clergy in general said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good Christian and that the Earth was a common mother of all human beings as Jesus Christ had been the savior of all mankind

Sylvia did not think that her Good Conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because her self-love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any Pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters although satisfied To Shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue

I had a name I believe in my young days but I have forgotten it since I have been in service
Sylvia was the Adoration of France and her Talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of Maryville for without her his comedies would never have gone to prosperity

brighter than Early Dawn's most brilliant dye are blown clear bands of color through the sky that swirl and sweep and meet to break and foam like rainbow veils Upon A bubbles Dome
Guided by you how we might stroll towards death our only music one another's breathe through Gardens intimate with hollyhocks where is silent poppies burn between the rocks by pools where Birches Bend to confidants above green waters scumbag with Lily plants
he had broken into her Courtyard
put Cotton Belt made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
when this has been accomplished the boolaroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzle because it had never done such a thing before
find glorious
I wouldn't mind a cup of coffee myself I've had considerable exercise this morning and I'm already for breakfast
the idea of patching cat and Bill to a goat was a vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
then he Rush downstairs into the courtyard shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody in his dominions at the Sailor Man was not recaptured
hold him fast I'm in and as soon as I have had my coffee and oatmeal I'll take him to the room of the great knife and Patch him
suggested that the captain of the guards looking for one to the other doubtfully and then nearly the same size as if you stand the boat on his hind legs they've both got the same style of whiskers and they're both of them arched in it and dangerous so they ought to make a good patch land
suppose it's a friend
the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for The Spectators to sit upon
as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolaroo gave a yellow of disappointment
control yourselves my dears replied the boo LaRue the worst punishment I know how to inflict on anyone this prisoner is about to suffer you will see a very pretty patchy my Royal daughters
in one place at the head of the room was erased platform for the royal family with elegant Throne chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the snub-nose princesses
the captain shook his head
why are you such a vegetables living creature we met and that was the spelling goat reply to Captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goats horns
they are for her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her
cant read wav file
but when I'm loose I mean to have just one good Shimmer to relieve my feelings
then I said in great haste for the door and go give a final but that sent the row of Royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified everyone within the sound of their voices
morning girls hope you feel as well as you look
Rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the Royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as to where haughty and overbearing
the goats War like Spirit was aroused by the successful attack
at once the goat gave a leap escape from the soldiers and without head rushed upon the bhullar
going toward the benches
before any good stop him he butted his majesty so furiously that the king sword far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning
you are a mate reply to sailor
then she gave Rosalie back her magic ring thanking the kind which for all she had done for them
the combined bands of both the countries play the music and a fine supper was served
so get the sizzle order the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving Beauties to their new home
that evening Trot gave a grand ball in the palace to which the most important of the pinkies in the blue skins were invited
when the blues can saw get kisses are they raised another great shout for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people
when first they entered the throne room they tried to be as hottie and scornful as ever but the blues who were assembled they are all laughed at them and jeered them for there was not a single person and all the blue country who loved the princess is the least little bit
as a private citizen I shall be a model of deportment because it would be dangerous to be otherwise
who had the parrot on his shoulder and they were supported by Captain Cora Lee and Captain and Rosalie the witch
the former blue grow
so they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl Queen and in a short time the blast of trumpets and roll of drums and Clashing of symbols told Trot and Captain bill that the blue bands had assembled before the palace
then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them
how will not be Wicked anymore by the old Blu-ray how re
the guards had a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the buhrow out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the Goat before Queen Trot who waited them in the throne room of the palace
when he finished she said cheerfully
since last Thursday I guess this is all have been the lawful bulero of the blue country but now that you are conquered by Queen Trot I suppose I am Concord too and you have no Beulah room at all
it will be such a satisfaction
don't worry Sizzle dear it'll all come right pretty soon
I'll gladly do that promise the new Beulah room and I'll feed the honorable go to all the shavings and leather in tin cans you can eat besides the grass
I neglected to tell you that you're not the Uluru anymore
now then let's enter the city and enjoy the great feast that's being cooked I'm nearly starve myself for this conquering kingdoms is hard work
as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ants sought by the consumer under this Canon of conspicuous waste
throughout the entire revolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to effectively mend the consumers good Fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities
the Salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
an article may be useful and wasteful both and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions
under the simple test of Effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find Leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset
but the actual cost of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme Leisure held the first place at the start and came to all the rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the course I peaceful culture
I reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is affected by resort to make believe many intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are found with some species object of amelioration and Body in their official style and title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talk is may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic
are the circumstances permitting that instinct disposes meant to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever it is of human use
constrict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
but it is another grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful
delivery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it
with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
whenever as in this case is the meaning of service in question has to do directly with a primary Leisure employment of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected on a different character
so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the Leisure Class A Noble such as Government fighting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employment
the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
the winners of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
the wearing of uniforms deliveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible
with a further advanced in culture this to be changed into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a taboo or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
search consumption as false to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labor and not the consumption directed to the wrong comfort and fullness of life
many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of less degree having turn attached to the person's a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers Etc
better ready at a point in economic Evolution far and dating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of goods as an Evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less celebrate system
many of these Affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time less amount of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers
so many of them however as make up the retainer and Hangers On of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification
the utility of consumption as an Evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth
under the taboo sudden victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
the custom of festive Gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives
the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's stress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial
in the nature of things luxuries and the Comforts of Life belong to the Leisure Class
there is a more or less elaborate system of ranking rates
drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore turned in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the second remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the Indulgence
it has even happened that the name for certain disease conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for Noble or gentle
this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth
the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect
in the communities of the western culture this point is a present found among the lower middle class
but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious Leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
among the country population it's places to some extent taken by savings and home Comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
in a general way though not totally nor consistently these two groups coincide
the dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these Duties are customarily performed gradually Narrows the wife Remains the last
the result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well-defined and considerable body of workmen
it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the households pecuniary decency
if but your comfort is achieved and it is more or less for 2 to circumstances if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort
the modern organization of Industry works in the same direction also by another line
very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away
it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its Best In Those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country
there is no class and no country that has yielded so objectively before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
